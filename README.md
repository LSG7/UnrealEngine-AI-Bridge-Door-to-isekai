# Door to isekai Project

## ✨ Notice:  
Local LLM in development. Release postponed.  
A quantum jump is happening.  
Please wait a little longer.  

## 💫 What is this?
- Problem:  
  We need AI to make game world but AI(LLM) doesn't understand unreal project and editor.  
- Solution:  
  'Door to isekai' UnrealEngine Plugin allows AIs(gpt,claude,gemini) to control the Unreal Engine editor.  
  It's the Unreal version of what's known as Vibe Coding.  
  AIs can understand and manipulate unreal project using this tool.
