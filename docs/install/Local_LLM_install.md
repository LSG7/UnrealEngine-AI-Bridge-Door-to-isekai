Our plugin operates on the MCP protocol. As long as your local LLM supports MCP, you can use our plugin.  
The Local LLM documentation you are using will probably have instructions on how to connect to the mcp server via stdio.  
You can use the 'Plugins/UnrealEngine_AI_Bridge/Resources/Scripts/mcp_bridge.py' file in stdio mode.
