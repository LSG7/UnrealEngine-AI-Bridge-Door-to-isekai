The AI ​​wrapper method is expensive for consumers, as the wrapper operator makes a profit during the ai communication process.    
I want as many people as possible to use AI affordably.   
Students should be able to use AI too.  

So I integrated Google's inexpensive tools, like the Google Gemini CLI, into my service.  
The cheapest way to use AI is for consumers to sign up directly with these companies' services.  
Gemini, Codex, and Claude also offer free usage.  
Signing up for a $20 flat rate plan with these companies will give you a pretty hefty usage allowance.  


And these companies' tools also provide context management and project management on their own.  


Local LLMs offer free access to AI. However, their performance is significantly different from that of large LLMs offered by companies like Google.  
In the future, I will offer a local LLM exclusively for Unreal for free.  

### I hope that anyone with a dream can use AI to create great games.
